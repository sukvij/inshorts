# API end points
    deon --> category --> from a specific category  -->  rank by publication date (most recent first).
    done --> score --> where relevence_Score > 0.7  --> rank by relevance_score (highest first)
    search --> 
        Perform a text search within the article title and description  -->  rank by a combination of relevance_score and text matching  score (how well the title/description matches the search query).
    done --> source --> retrieve from specific source --> rank by publication date (most recent first).
    done --> nearby --> 
        lat and long and radius given -->  rank by distance from the user's location (closest first). You may use the Haversine formula or another appropriate method to calculate the distance between two points given their latitude and longitude.

# Enrich the output
    Include a summary of the article's content (generated by the LLM).

# Response
    Return the top 5 most relevant news articles in a JSON format. The structure should be consistent across all simulated API endpoints. Each article should include:
        ■ Title
        ■ Description
        ■ URL
        ■ Publication Date
        ■ Source Name
        ■ Category
        ■ Relevance Score
        ■ LLM-Generated Summary
    Error --> proper error handling

    Metadata: 
        Consider including metadata in the response, such as the total number of results, the page number, and the query that was used.
Note
    use proper http methods
    base url --> /api/news  
        /api/news/category   
         /api/news/search
    for future updates --> /api/v1/news

query inputs
    GET  -->  /api/news/search?query=Elon+Musk&location=Palo+Alto   --> Query Parameters
    GET /api/news/nearby?lat=37.4220&lon=-122.0840&radius=10   --> location input
        

Bonus API
    TRending news feed --> tailored to a user's location. This should simulate a feed similar to “what’s trending near me” based on recent user engagement with articles




For "search", rank by a combination of relevance_score and text matching score
(how well the title/description matches the search query)
